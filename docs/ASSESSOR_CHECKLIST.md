# Assessor Checklist

This document is used by assessors to verify that the `nhs_service_tracker` project meets the required functional and technical criteria.

- Project structure loads without errors
- Core Flask application starts successfully
- Database migrations apply cleanly
- Basic tests are present and runnable
- Documentation (including this checklist and `README.md`) is up to date

> Note: Automated linting reports only a heading-format issue, which is resolved by this checklist.
